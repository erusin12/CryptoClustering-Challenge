# CryptoClustering-Challenge
 Challenge_19

This challenge involved the use of unsupervised learning.  We were predicting cyptocurrency changes.

We started with a starter code and I inlcuded a line to ensure the warning messages would not show up as they took up a lot of space on the page.  

The data was prepared and scaled and we did the KMeans to find the best value for k.  We then did a scatter plot after identifying the k value for the number of clusters.  
Next was the Principal Component Analysis to find the explained variance.  This data was put into a dataframe and we again found the best value for k with this data.  The elbow curve was created and we then mapped the scatterplot with the number of clusters we selected for k.  

We then created composite plots to compare the charts.

I completed this assignment with assistance from the instructor and internet resources.
